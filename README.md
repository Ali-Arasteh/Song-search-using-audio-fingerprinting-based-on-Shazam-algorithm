# Song-search-using-audio-fingerprinting-based-on-Shazam-algorithm
Implemented a song search engine, resistant to noise, computationally efficient, and massively scalable, capable of quickly identifying a song using a short segment of music captured by a cellphone microphone in the presence of foreground voices and other dominant noise, out of a database of millions of tracks. The algorithm uses a combinatorially hashed time-frequency constellation analysis of the audio, yielding unusual properties such as transparency, in which multiple tracks mixed together may each be identified. Furthermore, for applications such as radio monitoring, search times on the order of a few milliseconds per query are attained, even on a massive music database.
